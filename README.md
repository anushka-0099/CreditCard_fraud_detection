This repository deals with credit card fraud detection. The data is taken from kaggle, it has 29 features and 1 class label.
Steps to reproduce-
1) setup your kaggle api
2) run the starting lines of code
3) You will see a kaggle folder created
4) drag and drop you kaggle.json file into it and then proceed with other lines
## I have applied 3 Algorithms -logistic regression, gradient boosting and Random forest
** Befor applying these the class lables were imbalanced so I have ued undersampling technique to drop some rows of majority class.
